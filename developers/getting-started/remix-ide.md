# Remix IDE

Remix is a powerful, open source tool that helps you write Solidity contracts straight from the browser. Written in JavaScript, Remix supports both usage in the browser and locally.

Remix also supports testing, debugging and deploying of smart contracts and much more.

Ethereum remix can be directly used along with metamask using harmony custom rpcs as described in [here](https://docs.harmony.one/home/developers/deploying-on-harmony/using-remix/ethereum-remix).

However, we also have forked Remix and customized to Harmony [here](https://ide.harmony.one/#optimize=false\&evmVersion=null). A guide for deploying smart contracts using Harmony Remix is provided [here](https://docs.harmony.one/home/developers/deploying-on-harmony/using-remix/deployment-using-remix).
