## [Swap](https://swap.harmony.one)

Swap is a [Uniswap](http://uniswap.exchange) v3 Fork on Harmony. The decentralized exchange (DEX) gives users access to capital efficient liquidity pools.

Uniswap v2 required all users to provide liquidity across the entire price curve from 0 to infinity, Uniswap v3 allows Liquidity Providers (LPs) to optionally concentrate capital in the price range they believe will generate the highest return.
