# Staking Dashboard

Staking via browser is done via [Staking Dashboard](https://staking.harmony.one/). There you will be able to delegate, undelegate tokens, claim rewards and manage your delegations. Currently, staking transaction are supported on [Ledger Nano S/X,](../../../../general/wallets/hardware-wallets/ledger/) [Metamask](../../../../general/ecosystem/wallets/browser-extensions-wallets/metamask-wallet/) and [Math Wallet](../../../../developers/wallets/mathwallet.md).&#x20;

In order to choose their validators and manage their delegation, delegators have access to a range of information on the Staking Dashboard.
